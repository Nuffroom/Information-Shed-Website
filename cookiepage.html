                <h1>What are cookies?</h1><br><hr><br>
                <h2>Cookies is a term used all over the internet which serves as a placeholder for the small blocks of data created by a webserver while the user, you, is browsing a website.
                    These snippets of data are stored onto your computer or web browser during your cookie session.</h2><br>
                    <h1>Why do we collect cookies?</h1><br><hr><br>
                    <h2>Cookies serve many useful and sometimes essential functions on the web. They can enable web servers to store useful information (e.g., shopping cart information, these use
                        session cookies which are held temporarily in your browser and are delteted once the browser is closed down.)
                        onto the users device or track the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in or recording the pages whcih you last visited).
                        They can also be used to save information that the user previosuly entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords and payment card numbers for subsequent use.
                        Keep in mind that our website does not gather your information for malicous purposes and that under the European Privacy Directive, we are barred from such actions. We are
                        gathering information about all of our users with the purpose of personalising their experience on our website.
                    </h2><br>

                    <h1>How do cookies work?</h1><br><hr><br>
                    <h2>When you visit a website, your web server will transfer a small packet of data to your device's browser: a computer cookie. This cookie is designed to 
                        remember information about you, including a record of your search history and activity.
                    </h2>

                    <br><h1>What are some different types of cookies?</h1><hr><br>
                    <h2>The most common type of cookie is the <b>authetification cookie</b>, also known as the persistent cookie. These are commonly used during the login process on a website or other application,
                    this type of cookie is vital to the function of the login as the website checks if the user has a specific cookie to authenticate if the user is logged in or which account they are logged in with
                    Without the cookie, users would have to authenticate themselves by logging in on every page containing sensitive information that they wish to access. These cookies
                    usually contain data regarding expiration date, which is usually set to an extended duration of time, such as when you check the "remember me" box on a login page, a cookie
                    will be assigned for a set amount of time containing information for your login.</h2><br>
                    
                    <h2>The website providing the cookie will usually hide it behind some form of encrption to avoid the cookie data from being read by an attacker. Attackers who gain access to cookie information can then
                    view many user credentials and user data. They may also gain access to the login inforamtion regarding the user on one or more websites.</h2>
                    </h2><br>
                    <h1>Tracking Cookies</h1><br><hr><br>
                    <h2>Tracking cookies, also known as 3rd party cookies, are a separate type of cookie commonly used by 3rd party corporations to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing history into more refined dossiers containing processed information. This may then be sold to other 3rd party advertisers or used for their own means.
                        Privacy concerns for this potential outcome are what prompted European and US lawmakers to vote in favour of the enactment of privacy policies preventing such online dossiers from being formed.
                        In Europe, websites usually have to recieve some form of informed consent from their users before they can extract unnecessary cookies such as browser history
                        and storing other froms of non essential cookies on their device. Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the website youâ€™re visiting, often through embedded content like advertisements or videos.
                        These cookies are primarily used for tracking your online behavior across multiple websites.</h2><br>

                    <h1>How do 3rd party cookies work?</h1><br><hr><br>
                    <h2>You visit a website (website A) that contains an ad from an advertising network (website B).
                        When the ad loads, website B sets a cookie on your computer.
                        As you browse other websites that also contain ads from website B, the cookie allows website B to track your activity across these different sites.
                        A third-party cookie collects data about your online behavior and passes it on to advertisers for insightful advertising, enabling them to display targeted ads based on your activities.</h2>

                    </h2><br>

                    <h1>How can I avoid, prevent or deal with cookies?</h1><br><hr><br>
                    <h2>Some particularly malicous websites may include things like token loggers or viruses in their cookies. To avoid this happening to you, you can ensure that when
                        asked for consent regarding cookies that you either specify that your browser will take in only the necessary cookies or you can straight up decline; the choice is yours
                        and there is nothing stopping you. Do note that some cookies as mentioned earlier may be necessary for the function of the website.<br>

                        Another way of dealing with cookies is to clear your brower cache, this will delete all fast access or temporary information, including cookies. Additional browser settings management
                        options to deal with cookies could include adjusting how your browser stores these: most browsers will allow you to either view, block or delete cookies according to your own demands.
