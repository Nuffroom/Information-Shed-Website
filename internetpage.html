    <h1>How do I connect to my interent?</h1>
    <h2>Connecting to your network can be as simple as typing in a few characters in a string known as a wifi password.<br>
    These are commonly used in mesh networks that are usually found in households and through wireless connections.</h2>
        <br>
    <h1>But why do we use a mesh connection? Why shouldn't we?</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Mesh connections <div class="tooltip">[See figure]<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="mesh.jpeg" style="width:640px;height:426;"></span></div> are all interconnected either through a partial or full mesh. Some advantages of mesh networks include:
        <br>
        <li>
            It is easy to connect new devices to the network
           <li> Unlike other networks, this one will still function properly even when 1 device fails.
            <li>Efficient as there are few data collisions with the more direct routes for data passage.
            <li>This network, as said before, uses a password. This can make it especially secure form malicious files or packets. 
        </li>

        <br>
    <h2>On the other hand, mesh networks do require encrption to maintain their security.</h2><br>

    <h2>Once your device has been connected to a network, it will run packet information from the device's NIC(Network Interface Card) and to it's correspondinng router. <div class="tooltip">[See figure]<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="router.jpeg" style="width:640px;height:426;"></span></div>
    A packet is constituted using the architecture seen in <div class="tooltip">[See figure]<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="packet.jpeg" style="width:640px;height:426;"></span></div>.</h2><br> <h2>In terms of software requirements, you will typically need some sort of operating system on your device which can support network connections. Additionally, most devices will use some form of
    drivers which enable your device to communicate with your network.</h2>

    <h1>Wired Connections</h1><br>
    <h2>Popular wired networking formats include star or extended star networks.<div class="tooltip">[See figure]<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="starnet.jpeg" style="width:640px;height:426;"></span></div> These consist of many stations(computers) all connected to a central hub/switch which, in an extended star, are in turn
        connected to a server. All information moves from a station, to a hub and then to a server where it's destination is determined. This method comes with many advantages, namely:</h2><br>
        
    <h2>
        <li>Due to the hub connections, it is easy to connect new devices. The only drawback would be the price of the wiring
        <li>This system can still function even if 1 device fails, if the server or a hub fails then the whole network may fall too.
        <li>More direct routes between stations through hubs means that data transfer is more effficient and less data is lost through collisions.

        </li>
        </li>
        </li>
    </h2><br>
    <h2>
        On the otherhand, some disadvantages associated with star networks include:
    </h2><br>
    <h2>
        <li>System costs; wires, servers and hubs/switches all contribute to an enormous price.
        <li>May require skilled labour from a network manager to continue running the system without crashes or errors.
        </li>
    </li>
